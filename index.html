        <hr width="7%" align="left">
        <p>Sajek Valley is an emerging tourist spot in Bangladesh situated among the hills of the<br> Kasalong range of mountains in Sajek union, Baghaichhari Upazila in the Rangamati <br>District. The valley is 1,476 feet (450 m) above sea level. Sajek valley is known as the<br> Queen of Hills & Roof of Rangamati.</p>
        <p>Sajek is located in the verdant hills of Kasalong range of mountains amidst the serene<br> and exotic beauty of nature. Lofty mountains, dense forest, sprawling grasslands and<br> miles of hilly tracks feature the valley. The simple and basic indigenous lifestyle of<br> local people is just fabulous for visitors to spend a day.</p>
        <h1>How To Go</h1>
        <p>Though Sajek is located in the Rangamati district, it is much easier to travel with<br> Dighinalala of Khagrachari district. So first you have to come to Khagrachari. If you<br> want to go to Khagrachari from Dhaka, you can go by Saudia Paribahan, Shyamoli,<br> Shanti Paribahan, S. Alam, Eagle, etc on the bus. It will cost you nearly BDT 520 in the<br> Non-AC bus. If you want to go to the AC bus you will find BRTC or Saint Martin<br> Paribahan with BDT 700 to 900. Besides, the Shanti Paribahan goes directly to<br> Dighinala and it takes only BDT 580. There are counters of these buses at various<br> points of the city including Gabtali, Kalabagan in Dhaka. If you want to go on holidays,<br> it may be difficult to get a ticket if you donâ€™t buy the ticket before.</p>
        <p>The distance between Khagrachari and Sajek is about 70 km. You can visit Sajek Valley<br> by reserving Jeep Gari/Chander Gari from Khagrachari. It will cost you BDT 8000 to<br> 10000 with the returning fare. It is perfect for 12 to 15 people. But if you are in a small<br> group, then join with another group to reduce the cost. If it is not possible to find any<br> other group, then you can take CNG. It will cost you BDT from 4000 to 5000. However,<br> it is better not to travel by CNG as the road is very wavy.</p>
